# BioTables
**Data Visualisation Project using data from the fields of biology and biochemistry**

## Description
This project is ment to be an excercise on data visualisation and creating reports using rudimentary BI tools such as Google Docs Editors suite.

## Plan
The project is planned as follows:
1. Creating a set of simple Google Sheets (GS) tables
2. Visualising the data presented using basic GS visual tools
3. Simplifying the charts
4. Formatting them
5. Creating a report in Google Docs
6. Summing up the information in form of Google Slides

## Goals
By realising this project I will:
- better understand data visualisation and its design
- excercise basic computer literacy
- recall biological and biochemical facts
- have productive hollidays ;)

## Information Sources
The main source of information in this project is the book "Tablice Biologiczne" published by Adamantan (2013).
